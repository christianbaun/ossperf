This script analyzes the performance and data integrity of S3-compatible
storage services 

Arguments:
-h : show this message on screen
-n : number of files to be created
-s : size of the files to be created in bytes (max 16777216 = 16 MB)
-b : ossperf will create per default a new bucket ossperf-testbucket (or 
     OSSPERF-TESTBUCKET, in case the argument -u is set). This is not a 
     problem when private cloud deployments are investigated, but for 
     public cloud scenarios it may become a problem, because object-based 
     storage services implement a global bucket namespace. This means 
     that all bucket names must be unique. With the argument -b <bucket> 
     the users of ossperf have the freedom to specify the bucket name
-u : use upper-case letters for the bucket name (this is required for Nimbus 
     Cumulus and S3ninja)
-a : use the Swift API and not the S3 API (this requires the python client 
     for the Swift API and the environment variables ST_AUTH, ST_USER and 
     ST_KEY)
-m : use the S3 API with the Minio Client (mc) instead of s3cmd. It is 
     required to provide the alias of the mc configuration that shall be used
-z : use the Azure CLI instead of the S3 API (this requires the python client 
     for the Azure CLI and the environment variables AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT 
     and AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY)
-g : use the Google Cloud Storage CLI instead of the s3cmd (this requires
     the python client for the Google API)
-w : use the AWS CLI instead of the s3cmd (this requires the installation 
     and configuration of the aws cli client)
-r : use the s4cmd client. It can only interact with the AWS S3 service.  
     The tool uses the ~/.s3cfg configuration file if it exists. Otherwise it 
     will use the content of the environment variables S3_ACCESS_KEY and 
     S3_SECRET_KEY to access the AWS S3 service. For services that are not 
     AWS S3, it is required to provide the endpoint-url parameter with the IP 
     and Port addresses of the service, so please provide this as additional 
     parameter: http://<IP>:<PORT>
-l : use a specific site (location) for the bucket. This is supported e.g. 
     by the AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage
-d : If the aws cli shall be used with an S3-compatible non-Amazon service, 
     please specify with this parameter the endpoint-url
-k : keep the local files and the directory afterwards (do not clean up)
-p : upload and download the files in parallel
-o : appended the results to a local file results.csv
